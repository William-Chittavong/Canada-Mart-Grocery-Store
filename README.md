# Canada-Mart-Grocery-Store

This was an academic project for an intro to web programming course, SOEN 278 , where me and my partners created
a grocery store website that kept track of orders. The users would be able to select the items from the grocery store 
pages and save the total cost into their accounts.

The reason that I don't have any progress shown for my work or for my team mates is that during the creation of this project we did 
not use git to create the project.

I was in charge of the design of the soda page, adding and deleting the orders, and the form.
